 * Pond City is in danger! Evil Frog is mad af and the player needs to unlock a team of 4 Super Frogs by catching their 
 * respective costumes (a hat, clothing item, and accessory). They'll do this by choosing the frog they'd likee to unlock, 
 * then catching the correct set of items by moving the center frog and launching the tongue to capture the item.
 * Catch the three right items and you've unlocked a super frog! Catch the wrrong item and Evil Frog wins :(
 * 
 * Instructions (for me, real instructions will be in Read Me):
 * - Start game screen... where you start the game
 * - Real quick run down screen
 * - Choose the frog you'd like to unlock
 * - Move the frog with your mouse
 * - Click to launch the tongue
 * - Catch set of 3 correct item bubbles (bubble pop sound)
 * - x/3 counter up top right
 * - If right set: congrats screen, then back to unlock screen
 * - If wrong set: Evil Frog won screen, restart game, no mercy, the fate of Pond City was in YOUR hands
 * - If wrong set: they believed in you... (guilt trip player)
 * - Once all four frogs are unlocked: super cool cut scene of Super Frogs beating Evil Frog, no animation just picture, who do u think i am
 * - Game Over
 * 
 * Made with p5
