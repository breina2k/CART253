## Description

My Variation Jam project! This program has four variations, that you can choose through a level menu. Each variation follows my wizard frog character, that needs to find his clothes so that he can fight evil frog. 

The first variation contains thee items as well as bombs running across the screen. You control the frog with your mouse along the x axis, and catch the items with the frog tongue, while trying to avois the bombs!

The second varriation is similar, where you have to catch the items as they rain down from the top of the screen. Your goal hee is to catch 10 of the items while avoiding the recurring bombs.

The third variation changes the most. Here the three items are randomly spawned somewhere on the canvas, but they only become visible through the flashlight following the frog, which you move with keyboard arrows. 

The fourth and final variation is similar to the third, except for that I added a velociety and some constraints to the items so that they slowlyy move along the screen, making the goal either harder or easier depnding on your randomization luck (that bomb rreally follows you sometimes)

Instructions:

Press mouse or keypad to navigate thrrough different game scenes
Choose your level through the level menu
Press mouse of keypad to launch tongue
V1/V2: move frog with mouse
V3/V4: move frog with keyboard arrows
Avoid bombs or else evil frog wins
